                            <p><b>Q: Is there a reason to play the older Fire Emblem games?</b></p>
                            <p>A: Yes! All of them have a unique story and differences in gameplay, difficulty and general setting in addition to having a different roster altogether.<br>
                            Some of the early instalments of the license are even considered by fans to be the best in the series, so if you're curious about the Fire Emblem franchise, don't hesitate to give them a go!</p>

                            <p><b>Q: Has Nintendo always released all Fire Emblem games worldwide?</b></p>
                            <p>A: Nintendo has started publishing Fire Emblem games outside of Japan since the 7th entry, Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade (which is just titled "Fire Emblem" in America and Europe).<br>
                            However, it is still possible to play the earlier games still: the first entry, Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light has been rereleased internationally on the Nintendo Switch recently,
                            and the 11th, 12th and 15th games are remakes of earlier games, allowing you to discover those from another perspective.<br>
                            If you're able to get a hand on the original Japanese version of the earlier games, it is even possible for you to apply community-made fan translations to the game with the use of ROM dumping or other emulation techniques (as long as they're legal!)</p>

                            <p><b>Q: On what consoles can I play Fire Emblem games?</b></p>
                            <p>A: As Fire Emblem is owned by Nintendo, all games will be on Nintendo's consoles.<br>

                            <p><b>Q: Do all FE games take place in the same universe/share the same characters?</b></p>
                            <p>A: Most Fire Emblem games share some common elements i.e. the existence of magic, the existing technology... but most of them are set in different continents and do not interact with each other.
                                 For instance, characters in <i>FE: Blazing Blade</i> do not interact in any way with the characters/events of <i>FE: Sacred Stones</i> (even though both games were released on the same console and a few years apart).</p>
                            <p>However, some games share a common universe still. Here are the group of games which share a continent/characters/story elements in common:<br><br>
                            Archanea/Valentia Saga: <i>Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light, Gaiden</i> (takes place at the same time), <i>Mystery of the Emblem</i> (direct sequel to Shadow Dragon), <i>Shadow Dragon</i> (remake), <i>New Mystery of the Emblem</i> (remake), <i>Awakening</i> (1000 years after Mystery of the Emblem), <i>Echoes: Shadows of Valentia</i> (remake)<br>
                            Jugdral Saga: <i>Genealogy of the Holy War</i>, <i>Thracia 776</i> (takes place during the 1st part of Genealogy of the Holy War)<br>
                            Elibe Saga: <i>Binding Blade</i>, <i>Blazing Blade</i> (prequel, set 20 years before)<br>
                            Tellius Saga: <i>Path of Radiance</i>, <i>Radiant Dawn</i> (sequel, set 2 years after)<br><br>
                            Any game not mentioned in this list is considered "self sufficient", which means no other game relates to it as of now.</p>

                                    <p>This legendary entry in the series would find itself to be remade for the 3DS under the title <em>Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia</em>, capturing for the modern age what made the game so unique back then.</p>

                        <p>This website was made by me - Luka Bigot - as part of my Web Technologies assignment during my studies abroad.<br><br>
                        It was made with the main purpose of completing that assignment, but to also give some basic information to anyone who doesn't know about the Fire Emblem series.<br>
                        As such, this website has been made with the burning passion of a loving fan, and I hope you enjoy it!<br><br>
                        Since this website was done during my studies, huge thanks to my teacher, Peter Butcher - he's responsible for teaching me most of the stuff I made here! <a href="https://codepen.io/pbutcher" target="_blank">If you're interested about what he does, check out his CodePen!</a><br>
